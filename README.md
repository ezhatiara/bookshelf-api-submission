# ðŸ“š My GitHub Repository for "Back-End Application Development for Beginners"

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ As a student, I'm excited to share my GitHub repository for the "Back-End Application Development for Beginners" course. This course is offered by Dicoding Indonesia, and it's perfect for beginners like me who want to dive into the world of Back-End Development.

## ðŸ’¡ About the Course

This course is a fantastic opportunity for individuals who are eager to explore the world of Back-End Development. By the end of this course, you'll be able to create your own simple RESTful API to support various application functionalities.

## ðŸ“– What I'll Learn

Throughout the course, I'll:

- Discover the vital role Back-End plays in web development.
- Understand how clients and servers communicate through the HTTP protocol.
- Explore the architecture of RESTful APIs.
- Get familiar with Node.js, including global and process objects, modularization, Node Package Manager (NPM), eventing, file systems, and streaming techniques.
- Build Web Services using Node.js, both natively and through the Hapi framework.
- Create a simple RESTful API.

## What's on the Syllabus

Here's what I'll be learning:

### Introduction to Back-End (3 Hours)

I'll start by grasping the fundamentals of Back-End Development, including the roles of front-end and back-end, client-server communication through HTTP, and the architecture of RESTful APIs.

### Basics of Node.js (8 Hours)

I'll delve into Node.js and get to know its core concepts, such as global and process objects, modularization, Node Package Manager (NPM), event handling, file systems, and streaming techniques.

### Building Web Services with Node.js (10 Hours)

This is where the magic happens! I'll learn how to construct Web Services using Node.js, both natively and through the Hapi framework. I'll even build a simple RESTful API.

### Deploying Web Services (5 Hours)

I'll discover Amazon EC2, learn to operate it through SSH, and run my very own RESTful APIs on Amazon EC2. It's like taking my newfound skills to the cloud!

### Consuming and Testing RESTful APIs using Postman (5 Hours)

Postman is my new best friend. I'll install it, use it to consume RESTful APIs for testing, and even write automated test scenarios. Testing has never been this fun!

## Course Evaluation

As part of my learning journey, I'll be working on a practical project â€“ the Bookshelf API. This project involves creating the Back-End of a note-taking application with functionalities that include Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

I'm super excited to share my progress and projects on GitHub. Let's learn and grow together! ðŸš€ðŸ˜ƒ
